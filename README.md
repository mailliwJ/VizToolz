# VizToolz

A simple script of useful functions i have been working on to help with visualization during data analysis.
This is an on going project that gets edited as new use cases arise or new ideas come to mind.

The basic idea came from a Bootcamp i am currently completing with The Bridge Digital Talent in Data Science. A script of useful functions for visualization was shared with students to use freely in activities and exercises and i have been editting and adding to these functions throughout the course. Some of the functions in this module are completely new and i have made based on specific use cases that have recurred throughout the course. Other functions have simply been tweaked to meet my own needs and idiosyncracies.

The latest addition to this project is that i have packaged it for easier use across future projects and to avoid having
the script saved in multiple directories.

the following table provides a summary of the functions in my Viztoolz module:
